I have traveled frequently, in much of the world, especially central Europe, including Hungary and Slovakia. In recent years I have had many trips to Mexico, where I buy folk art for my online business, called Viva Oaxaca Folk Art. I love meeting new people, especially travelers with stories to tell.  

In addition to the above, I run web sites for small companies, including a physical therapy practice, a cancer treatment center and a colonial era historic house and museum. 

In the 1980s, I was a publicist and concert producer, and have presented many concerts with Judy Collins, as well as with Ella Fitzgerald, Laura Nyro, Tom Rush, Barbara Cook and Karen Akers. Now I run a channel on YouTube called ""beta.hifi.archive"" that is a collection of 50 years of video clips from the career of Judy Collins.

Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them.

I am a jewelry designer/stylist living and working in NYC. 
I love to travel, and in my ventures, I find that clean, hospitable, well-kept and well-designed accommodations can sometimes make or break the trip. That's why when I was introduced to Airbnb, I was intrigued and chose to sign up and join the family and community.

I find that both as a host and as a guest, the most integral part is to be respectful and very mindful of people's space. The rest - to enjoy to the fullest your ventures, travels and life in general!

MY INTERESTS

I’m an art lover, my inspiration is Boston’s own Isabella Stewart Gardner and my objective is to make the house look like an art museum, but still retain all the comforts of home!

I’m dedicated to healthy living and love discussing topics from diet to neuroscience. I literally can't live without enough sleep, healthy food, and exercise!

I’m an avid reader, with a huge personal library on display throughout the house- I’ve been in my local book club for over 20 years.

I’m a Francophile. I study French but I'm in need of some exercises and classes to bring my conversational French up to speed! So I meet with neighbors here in the south End every 2nd and 4th Tuesday to speak in French over lunch!

Theater, I'm a big supporter and have even been in many plays myself. I also sing in the Boston Gay Men's Choir.

MY INTERESTS

I’m an art lover, my inspiration is Boston’s own Isabella Stewart Gardner and my objective is to make the house look like an art museum, but still retain all the comforts of home!

I’m dedicated to healthy living and love discussing topics from diet to neuroscience. I literally can't live without enough sleep, healthy food, and exercise!

I’m an avid reader, with a huge personal library on display throughout the house- I’ve been in my local book club for over 20 years.

I’m a Francophile. I study French but I'm in need of some exercises and classes to bring my conversational French up to speed! So I meet with neighbors here in the south End every 2nd and 4th Tuesday to speak in French over lunch!

Theater, I'm a big supporter and have even been in many plays myself. I also sing in the Boston Gay Men's Choir.

Writing from my home in the JP neighborhood of Boston. Today I got to stay at home. I work freelance in film production so I get a lot of time off between projects. My job is best described as ""art department"" although, set builder, propmaker, prop, effects, set dresser... are other terms for the work I do. Anyway, art dept. is what I write on my time cards. Today I did none of that. I fixed up a couple of 80's Japanese road bikes and one 60's Raleigh 3 speed in the sun in front of our house. Me and my daughter are getting ready to go down to NYC where we will set up our wares for sale on the street in Brooklyn (15 bikes and a table of her arts and crafts). Can't wait. It's super fun to be on the street talking to the people, hearing the music from the passing traffic, smiling at the ladies, eating crazy street food, and putting people on nice bikes. This is the best kind of day for me. It's got everything, travel, all kinds of people, my daughter w/ me, friends dropping by, a couple bucks in my pocket, truck tacos, street fashion... Magdalena , my 15 year old, creative, self possessed, funny, daughter makes me feel proud and secure when she hawks her crafts. I look at her talk everyone, so confident, open hearted but savvy, and I feel like she's gonna be okay where ever she goes. The art of survival. I'm an artist. Sculptor. Went to art school. Can make anything. But what I love most to make is my way thru life. It's the best art. But unlike art it is totally accessible because everyone does it. blaa blaa... back to today... I also did some drawings for a chicken coop that I'm going to build next week with my buddy Jenny. Some local chicken activists approached us with the project. These chicken people want to repeal laws that prevent keeping chickens in the city of Boston. They would like to display some chickens at our local earth/may day festival in a clean,(hopefully) well designed, urban chicken coop. What else? I fixed the passenger side headlight of my truck, paid some bills, ate some mochi, did the dark laundry, made some calls to spread the word about a friend who is on his last legs in a fight w/cancer, pulled some bamboo shoots that were creeping ever further out of their corner of the yard. Magdalena came home tonight beaming. There was an after school dance, ice cream with friends afterwards and thrift shopping after that. She sat on the couch and gave me a play by play of her day. I love that
Well, there it is. I think that worked out pretty good. It's a good thing I didn't work today or you'd of heard all about it...
IE: today I built a city diorama in 1"":1' scale. Went pretty smooth but the tiny bus stop benches looked gigantic next to the wee news paper boxes. Weird because both were built with out straying from the 1"":1' format. It just goes to show you, sometimes it's best to set the rules aside and go with your eye and your heart.

I love to enhance the guest  experience.  Perhaps that’s why I’ve been a “Super Host” for most of my 4 seasons hosting for Airbnb.  I also love my home.  It gives me great joy to share it with travelers from around the earth.  While confessing my longcomings, I am also a clean freak.  I won’t be underfoot while you are here, just in preparing for you.  Having an eclectic 1860s townhouse has me going into contortions cleaning out nooks and crannies that could pass the more casual eye.

Each year, with my earnings from Airbnb, I make updates and remodel rooms I get bored with.  2018  my kitchen was a DIY project that I am quite proud about.  I’m curious to get your opinion.  I let the professionals redo my dining room walls and ceilings removing wall paper and adding a beautiful  paint color from the historic collection.  Previous years had me update my very large shared bathroom.  Although shared, I never got any complaints about availability but praises on its lushness.  I hope I don’t jinx myself.  Every pipe and my heating system has been replaced, although not a fun expenditure, reliability has its value.  My seasonal backyard has more privacy and is a go to vacation spot in a hurry.

Since the large bathroom is shared, I try to compensate for the possible inconvenience by offering s free continental breakfast at your convenience, coffee and tea at any time with or without my famous home baked cookies. Bottled water is placed in your room along with lots of brochures on local favorites.

I also offer airport pickup/drop off for those travelers who want to hit the ground running.  I could take you back to get settled or drop you off at a destination.  When you arrive later, your luggage will be waiting for you in your room.  Fault me if you will but I have no interest in changing!  I also share my driveway for one vehicle.  Although there is free non-restricted parking on my street, late arrivals have the convenience of easy access for loading and unloading.  I do have two guest rooms so make sure you request the space in advance or the other guest or myself will be parked there.

I look forward to hosting you.  If you need privacy, you will get it.  If you are looking for interaction, you will get it.  I love doing both.

Can’t wait to meet you!!

That afforded me the opportunity to travel throughout Eastern Europe and Russia.  Since then I have worked in the Balkans, and have also traveled throughout Africa.

One of the great things that I enjoy in Boston is it’s open space.  My home is located within several blocks of three of those great parks.  Another great treasure in the Boston area--and one of the reasons that I moved to Boston--is it’s location on the ocean, and the opportunity to sail.  You can go on whale watches, cruises around the harbor, or take the water taxi to visit Old Ironsides.  Boston also has wonderful museums and a great public transportation system to take you there.

I traveled back and forth to Boston during the mid-80's and 90's. I'm the founder of a non-profit organization here in Boston called, ""Bikes Not Bombs"" (BNB) where i worked for 25 years coordinating the international work as well as helping to start the inner city youth programs here in Boston and a bike shop which BNB currently operates.  Twenty years ago, my partner, Cecilia, and I started to create a family, we have one 19 year old son named Ziggy. Cecilia is from Argentina and we are all bi-lingual Spanish and English speaking. Cecilia is currently working as a case manager for a live-at-home elderly services and support organization. In 2010 my family and I traveled by public busses for two years, homeschooling our son and witnessing life in nine South and Central American countries. We started the trip by car camping across the USA for 3 months, then selling the car, flying to Buenos Aires and slowly returning over land by bus, boat, and train, on two occasions we also did WOOFING on family farms.   
I'm currently doing carpentry and handyman work, but because of some issues with pinched nerves i'm looking to find more ways to make a living including airbnb.  I love traveling, bird watching, hiking in nature, fishing, books, cooking, art, bike riding and sustainable organic gardening among other things. I tend our 30' by 60' garden and grape arbor which makes our house exceptionally nice from May to November.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

My career is in finance. I work for an Italian energy company. I also work part time helping senior citizens in their homes with care needs. 
I’ve been part of the air bnb community for several years now. I too love to travel and experience new cultures. Hosting people from around the world has been a great experience that I have truly enjoyed. I raised six children (yours, mine and ours) My kids range from ages 24 through 28 and I have 3 grandchildren. 
I moved into the city of Boston 6 years ago. The culture is bright, enthusiastic and alive with a feeling of constant rebirth - students moving in, moving out, medical professionals coming in and then moving on, business professionals attending conventions and tourists visiting our fine city and then returning home - It is truly a magical place and there is no where that I would rather be - well...ok - maybe I would like to be in Namibia, South Africa.

We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

While in Boston I try to balance things out between working away as a code monkey and trying to pull together a startup. With a few hours still going to waste, I've gone back to school with evening classes up in Harvard Extension. 

I love having friends over - I'll throw together some random event, be it Johnny Appleseed Cider Fest or a Spaceballs movie night. Something to get friends together. 

I've had a few guests now and I'm still trying to nail this hosting business - going from just ensuring the place is clean and tidy to trying to see how I can make your trip more enjoyable.

I started on Airbnb with ""Gorgeous Cape Cod"" property in May 2015, listed our renovated ""Stunning South End Back Bay Penthouse"" in August 2015, and listed our newly renovated ""Beautiful Boston Brownstone"" in August 2016. We also just launched both Boston units together for larger parties - ""Luxury Brownstone Penthouse Duplex""! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 15 years and was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status every single quarter since we began (we have more than 150 5 star reviews)!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, I am married to David, my partner in life and all things real estate and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is a rising senior at Northwestern University in Chicago.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

We can tell you where to go for the best restaurants and events happening around the city.  Keeping up to date with new dining and entertainment venues is something we really enjoy. We work a ton and don't get away as much as we like lately, so we love to entertain and are also Airbnb hosts.  We both have hospitality industry experience and keeping our guests happy and providing them with all of the information they need to enjoy their stay is one of the best parts of hosting. We look forward to meeting you during our travels or in the company of our home! Come stay with us and experience Boston like a local!

MY INTERESTS

I’m an art lover, my inspiration is Boston’s own Isabella Stewart Gardner and my objective is to make the house look like an art museum, but still retain all the comforts of home!

I’m dedicated to healthy living and love discussing topics from diet to neuroscience. I literally can't live without enough sleep, healthy food, and exercise!

I’m an avid reader, with a huge personal library on display throughout the house- I’ve been in my local book club for over 20 years.

I’m a Francophile. I study French but I'm in need of some exercises and classes to bring my conversational French up to speed! So I meet with neighbors here in the south End every 2nd and 4th Tuesday to speak in French over lunch!

Theater, I'm a big supporter and have even been in many plays myself. I also sing in the Boston Gay Men's Choir.

I like to refer to myself as a retired elementary teacher although I spent the last quarter of my career as an administrator.  But my teaching years were my best.  The daily student teacher interaction, the laughter and frustrations, the little signs of progress, made the work so fulfilling.

I grew up on a very successful produce and dairy farm in Southeastern Massachusetts.  Our main cash crop was tomatoes but we raised all kinds of vegetables.  They were trucked into Boston.  In the winter the dairy supported us.  My childhood exposed me to hard work but also to a love for the outdoors and nature.

Out of college I worked for the Department of Defense as a teacher in their overseas dependents' schools.  I taught in Istanbul and Seville, Spain.  I was able to travel extensively through Europe for three years.

Upon returning to the States I began teaching in Quincy, Massachusetts, where I remained for thirty years.  The last seven years were spent as a principal of an elementary school which has a majority population of Asian students.  I traveled to China one summer to explore my students' heritage and culture.

In the interim I married Joyce Brothers.  Joyce is a case manager for Boston Senior Home Care.  Her passion is cooking and she is a graduate of the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts.

She and I have raised two children.  Our daughter is a school teacher.  Our son, born in Brazil, is a hair stylist.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Perhaps that’s why I’ve been a “Super Host” for most of my 4 seasons hosting for Airbnb.  I also love my home.  It gives me great joy to share it with travelers from around the earth.  While confessing my longcomings, I am also a clean freak.  I won’t be underfoot while you are here, just in preparing for you.  Having an eclectic 1860s townhouse has me going into contortions cleaning out nooks and crannies that could pass the more casual eye.

Each year, with my earnings from Airbnb, I make updates and remodel rooms I get bored with.  2018  my kitchen was a DIY project that I am quite proud about.  I’m curious to get your opinion.  I let the professionals redo my dining room walls and ceilings removing wall paper and adding a beautiful  paint color from the historic collection.  Previous years had me update my very large shared bathroom.  Although shared, I never got any complaints about availability but praises on its lushness.  I hope I don’t jinx myself.  Every pipe and my heating system has been replaced, although not a fun expenditure, reliability has its value.  My seasonal backyard has more privacy and is a go to vacation spot in a hurry.

Since the large bathroom is shared, I try to compensate for the possible inconvenience by offering s free continental breakfast at your convenience, coffee and tea at any time with or without my famous home baked cookies. Bottled water is placed in your room along with lots of brochures on local favorites.

I also offer airport pickup/drop off for those travelers who want to hit the ground running.  I could take you back to get settled or drop you off at a destination.  When you arrive later, your luggage will be waiting for you in your room.  Fault me if you will but I have no interest in changing!  I also share my driveway for one vehicle.  Although there is free non-restricted parking on my street, late arrivals have the convenience of easy access for loading and unloading.  I do have two guest rooms so make sure you request the space in advance or the other guest or myself will be parked there.

I look forward to hosting you.  If you need privacy, you will get it.  If you are looking for interaction, you will get it.  I love doing both.

Can’t wait to meet you!!

I have good taste and adore creature comforts. My style is neatness, art, and books with a judicious dash of knickknack. I have a thing for fluffy towels, so you will have a good supply!  I love flowers, so you may see an efflorescence of fresh color here and there. And, most important, I love excellent coffee. So don't worry, here in this corner of America, there will be excellent single origin coffee ;-) 

I know the city well.  With me, no best-kept secret is safe. I can tell you about some little known places of interest and some great restaurants. I can also tell you things like where to go for a great view, where to go if it's raining, and where to go for the best hot chocolate. Thank you for checking out my listing. I look forward to welcoming you into my lovely Victorian home and helping you with your visit to Boston!

My name is Sarah, I was born in Morocco and have been a Bostonian for the past seven years. Prior to date, I lived and studied in France for seven years.

My childhood in Morocco taught me Arabic, French, empathy, respect, resourcefulness, flexibility and quick problem solving skills.

My parents gave me their thirst for learning and continuous improvement, their professionalism, work ethic and dedication.

My seven years in France sharpened my taste in European pastry, Caribbean music and fed my general knowledge.

My seven years so far in the US awakened my passion for running and thrift shopping.

Now ? I am :

- making my way in the fascinating world of Non Profit Project Management.
- running 10k every two days.
- learning Spanish.
- reading every book I can find by Marcel Rufin.
- watching religiously Suits every Thursday and Ballers every Sunday.

My husband and I have been using Airbnb as guests for the past 2 years and started hosting ourselves on August 2015. We are multilingual, curious about every other culture and traveling is basically a second nature (as much as an addiction).

Looking forward to meet you as guest or host (or who knows, maybe both).

Warm regards,

Sarah.

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

I'm retired 60 year old professional person.   I spend part of my winters in Florida or the Caribbean, summers in Provincetown, Cape Cod, Massachusetts and the rest of my time in Boston.  My professional career started and ended in real estate and construction, my fun and passion.  I've traveled Europe a number of times and lots of time in Costa Rica, Panama and a few other Caribbean countries.  I hope to one day soon to have a return visit to Cuba!! I speak a little Spanish but can understand it more.  I love to immerse myself in the local culture during my travels.  I've never been on a cruise but I have done one ""all inclusive"" resort to attend a destination wedding.  It was more fun than I expected it would be : )

I enjoy meeting new people from all over.  Sometimes we might be able to have a dinner together, though I might not be in Boston during part or all of your stay. 

I'm a bit of a news junky and I enjoy TV shows on  HGTV and The Animal Planet channels.  

I eat dinner out several nights each week, but also enjoy cooking at home.  I enjoy many types of foods  but primarily I eat Italian and Thai and anything fish or seafood related!

My style of travelling is casual and prefer a small guesthouse or airbnb.  I like to live like the locals when I travel.

I'm retired 60 year old professional person.   I spend part of my winters in Florida or the Caribbean, summers in Provincetown, Cape Cod, Massachusetts and the rest of my time in Boston.  My professional career started and ended in real estate and construction, my fun and passion.  I've traveled Europe a number of times and lots of time in Costa Rica, Panama and a few other Caribbean countries.  I hope to one day soon to have a return visit to Cuba!! I speak a little Spanish but can understand it more.  I love to immerse myself in the local culture during my travels.  I've never been on a cruise but I have done one ""all inclusive"" resort to attend a destination wedding.  It was more fun than I expected it would be : )

I enjoy meeting new people from all over.  Sometimes we might be able to have a dinner together, though I might not be in Boston during part or all of your stay. 

I'm a bit of a news junky and I enjoy TV shows on  HGTV and The Animal Planet channels.  

I eat dinner out several nights each week, but also enjoy cooking at home.  I enjoy many types of foods  but primarily I eat Italian and Thai and anything fish or seafood related!

My style of travelling is casual and prefer a small guesthouse or airbnb.  I like to live like the locals when I travel.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

I am an avid user of the AirBnB platform as both a host and a guest and am very glad to be part of this awesome community.  As a host, I focus on treating my guests the way I would like to be treated!  A lot of time and effort is spent to ensure the house is well decorated and clean, bed sheets and towels are washed and ironed, and all the basic necessities are available so that guests feel as if they have found a home away from home! 

When I am not hosting guests from around the world in Boston, I go out and explore the world and stay in AirBnB properties regularly.  I treat my host homes as I would my own and am always happy to talk and get to know my hosts and their recommendations!

Thank you for being part of this community and reading my profile. I hope we can connect soon!

I started on Airbnb with ""Gorgeous Cape Cod"" property in May 2015, listed our renovated ""Stunning South End Back Bay Penthouse"" in August 2015, and listed our newly renovated ""Beautiful Boston Brownstone"" in August 2016. We also just launched both Boston units together for larger parties - ""Luxury Brownstone Penthouse Duplex""! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 15 years and was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status every single quarter since we began (we have more than 150 5 star reviews)!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, I am married to David, my partner in life and all things real estate and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is a rising senior at Northwestern University in Chicago.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

Warmest regards

Sue

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

We are known for our distinctively furnished apartments in popular locations, and for our attentive service. You’ll find that our rates are quite reasonable. If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge. 

Please contact us to confirm the exact availability of the apartment you are interested in. We’d love to host you (and your family) for your vacation or business trip.

My large family are / were all long-time Boston residents, and most of the members still own apartments from when they lived in downtown Boston.  All of my condo's are owned by members of my family.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

If you stay with us during the summer months, we'd love to take you out on our 50-ft yacht for a complimentary afternoon sail and lunch (catered by a restaurant / bar we own) around the Boston Harbor (schedule and availability permitting).

My large family are / were all long-time Boston residents, and most of the members still own apartments from when they lived in downtown Boston.  All of my condo's are owned by members of my family.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

I started on Airbnb with ""Gorgeous Cape Cod"" property in May 2015, listed our renovated ""Stunning South End Back Bay Penthouse"" in August 2015, and listed our newly renovated ""Beautiful Boston Brownstone"" in August 2016. We also just launched both Boston units together for larger parties - ""Luxury Brownstone Penthouse Duplex""! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 15 years and was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status every single quarter since we began (we have more than 150 5 star reviews)!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, I am married to David, my partner in life and all things real estate and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is a rising senior at Northwestern University in Chicago.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

Warmest regards

Sue

We are Romo and Nayeli - a young married couple living in Boston.

We are both originally from Texas, but met and got married in China. We both love to travel and are always planning new adventures.  Anywhere we go, we are always seeking for the latest culinary experience or that perfect balanced cocktail from a local bar tender.

Right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We truly believe that hospitality is the art of making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  It's the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always.  
 
Now, we have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand, spent time studying in Spain before moving to Beijing  in 2000 after graduating.  

Nayeli and I met in Shenzhen, China in 2010 and in 2015 we tied the knot in the great city of Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we decided to repatriate back to the US after 16 years of living and working abroad.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US, and even more so when we get the opportunity to call Boston home.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel.

I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people.

We are Romo and Nayeli - a young married couple living in Boston.

We are both originally from Texas, but met and got married in China. We both love to travel and are always planning new adventures.  Anywhere we go, we are always seeking for the latest culinary experience or that perfect balanced cocktail from a local bar tender.

Right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We truly believe that hospitality is the art of making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  It's the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always.  
 
Now, we have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand, spent time studying in Spain before moving to Beijing  in 2000 after graduating.  

Nayeli and I met in Shenzhen, China in 2010 and in 2015 we tied the knot in the great city of Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we decided to repatriate back to the US after 16 years of living and working abroad.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US, and even more so when we get the opportunity to call Boston home.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

We are known for our distinctively furnished apartments in popular locations, and for our attentive service. You’ll find that our rates are quite reasonable. If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly.

I am Joanna, a current candidate in a Master’s program in Sustainable International Development at Brandeis! As a student in an international program, I truly value traveling in addition to music and other hobbies involving exploring the world. I believe Airbnb is a great platform for anyone who wants to travel and enjoys visiting different places and cultures! 
 
I've lived in Spain, grew up in North Carolina, and now consider myself a Bostonian. My home in South Boston is very comfortable and right next the beach where I enjoy jogging in the mornings! I would like to share my place while I'm Airbnbing since I believe my home will bring happiness and a true Boston experience :) 
 
When I'm not traveling or studying, I enjoy nonfiction books such as ""A New Earth Awakening"" By Eckhart Tolle or simply relaxing at the beach near Castle Island. 
 
As a host, I will do my best to provide you with a very comfortable stay in my home and provide with the very best tips for visiting Boston. As a guest, I will respect your home and truly appreciate the space given to me.

Some of our favorite destinations are Croatia, Bosnia, Egypt, Italy, Cape Verde and Greece. Traveling comes from our love of culture and history. We love to participate in local adventures, attend events happening wherever we are, but most importantly, meet new people and try new cuisines!  Music is a huge part of our lives, all genres, and if we have down time, we kick up our feet and watch a movie! We can tell you where to go for the best restaurants and events happening around the city.  Keeping up to date with new dining and entertainment venues is something we really enjoy. We work a ton and don't get away as much as we like lately, so we love to entertain and are also Airbnb hosts.  We both have hospitality industry experience and keeping our guests happy and providing them with all of the information they need to enjoy their stay is one of the best parts of hosting.

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people.

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people. 

I love the freedom. I experience a great feeling of independence from traveling. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want. I can sleep in. I can stay out late.

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people. 

I love the freedom. I experience a great feeling of independence from traveling. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want. I can sleep in. I can stay out late.

I love living in the city, but also enjoy getting away for work or visiting my husband’s relatives in Greece.

I have been renting my apartments for decades, although furnished now, I know how important it is to make your stay easy and comfortable. Your accommodations are exactly as advertised. The amenities are as luxurious as our former wonderful guests specify. The apartment is short term rental specifically designed for your total comfort. As our guests mentioned ""The pictures don’t do it any justice.""

My husband Alex and I take the feedback we have gotten from our initial guests very seriously, and have implemented all suggestions to improve the apartment and the experience…. Even though all of our reviews are very positive, we strive to always improve ourselves and our apartments.

As a host, we will be as involved with your trip as much as you want. If you would like to get recommendations as to where to go, what to do, and places to eat we will most certainly help you with that, but if you rather be left alone, we will let you enjoy your privacy of your own apartment while visiting Boston.

Enjoy your visit to Boston and when you are finished with your day of tourism or work, you can return to your rental home. REST and RELAX in a clean and well-appointed apartment. The goal is that you have a worry free and comfortable stay. 

Welcome to Boston and its historic South End!

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling.

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people.

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

I very much subscribe to the MIT ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" way of life. I enjoy beer and wine. I also enjoy aged rums and whiskeys on occasions. I love outdoor activities, including but not limited to hiking, backpacking, snowboarding, skiing, horseback riding, biking, running, kayaking, canoeing, and sailing. I love running but don't do it nearly as much as I woud like. I have played in sports teams throughout my life, including basketball, soccer, crew, and softball. One of my dreams is to go to space although for now I'll settle for looking at this wonderful planet from 8,848 m or below. I am very close to my family and fraternity brothers but I also love meeting new people and getting out of the routine.

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

We are known for our distinctively furnished apartments in popular locations, and for our attentive service. You’ll find that our rates are quite reasonable. If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge.

3 things I cannot live without:

-My phone: Unfortunately (fortunately?) I fully embrace being connected, I love social media because I have friends all across the world, and it helps me stay in touch with people I care about.

-A good book (or 5) I'm currently reading: I like being immersed in a book. Lately, I've been reading a lot of non-fiction, but I love a good fantasy book to lose myself within.

-A good pair of headphones: I've been listening to a lot of podcasts lately, especially while I'm doing work that might be a little more tedious, or when I'm driving. 

My style of traveling: I'm not a huge planner; while traveling I like to plan for one thing to do per day, and just go wander for the rest of the day.

There are many great cycling routes and paths to explore.

I am Joanna, a current candidate in a Master’s program in Sustainable International Development at Brandeis! As a student in an international program, I truly value traveling in addition to music and other hobbies involving exploring the world. I believe Airbnb is a great platform for anyone who wants to travel and enjoys visiting different places and cultures! 
 
I've lived in Spain, grew up in North Carolina, and now consider myself a Bostonian. My home in South Boston is very comfortable and right next the beach where I enjoy jogging in the mornings! I would like to share my place while I'm Airbnbing since I believe my home will bring happiness and a true Boston experience :) 
 
When I'm not traveling or studying, I enjoy nonfiction books such as ""A New Earth Awakening"" By Eckhart Tolle or simply relaxing at the beach near Castle Island. 
 
As a host, I will do my best to provide you with a very comfortable stay in my home and provide with the very best tips for visiting Boston. As a guest, I will respect your home and truly appreciate the space given to me.

I've kayaked from Cambridge, down the Charles River, through the locks, out into Boston Harbor, and into a dock outside The Barking Crab restaurant for a lunch of fried clams—a local favorite! I've been to New Orleans to work with Habitat for Humanity in rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina. I've hiked the White Mountains. I've trekked France, I've studied Spanish in Madrid, I've tossed bread crumbs to fish in Greece. 

Come to Boston, and I'll do everything I can to make sure you make wonderful new travel memories here, dining under my grape arbor, visiting your children's college, walking the Freedom Trail or whatever else you wind up doing!

Thanks for checking out my properties!  

My name is Dawn and I have been living in beautiful historical Charlestown for the last 16 years. My property is near and dear to my heart as this was my grandparents home that I pretty much grew up in and that I bought after they passed away. I recently decided to turn my beautiful peice of property into a place where visitors can come and enjoy all this wonderful city has to offer while staying in a place of history vs a hotel!  You will enjoy staying here and all this city has to offer_ I will make sure of it!  :)

I live within one mile of my grandparents' first rented apartments.  I'm still close to a rather large extended family and network of friends throughout the Boston area.  We have loved being here, for 3 generations in a row. In my professional life I am a health policy researcher and professor of medicine in Boston. Outside of family and work, my interests include art, architecture, and music. 

Walking distance: 
Fort Hill and Highland Park are great for walking. In the mornings, head up to a revolutionary war fort (5 minutes) and an 1875 water standpipe that brought city plumbing to Roxbury. Eliot Square a few blocks away is home to an classic New England 1805 church, the oldest surviving wood structure church in the city. Walk 10 minutes to Dudley Square in one direction or Roxbury Crossing and the orange line MBTA subway Stationen the other. 

Short distance by subway or cab:
We are located within three subway stops of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (Andris Nelsons conducting is not to be missed), and 10 minutes by cab to the Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. We are within four subway stops of Copley Square, the Pru, South End Restaurants and cafes, shopping on Newbury and Charles Streets, Boston Public Gardens. You are staying in one of Boston's most exciting neighborhoods on one of its best streets.

If you want to explore Cambridge, Fenway Park, Harvard, MIT, the North End, the Boston Aquarium, Olmsted's Emerald Necklace, the Rose Kennedy Greenway, Boston Harbor (the ""hahbah"") or wherever your travel guide takes you, this home is located centrally.

Hosting and meeting people from all over the world is amazing- it makes me happy also; it is incredible what technology has allowed us to achieve in this way, here it is actually bringing people together.  Since I started hosting guests with Air' I have established some of the most spectacular friendships, exceeding my expectations.  It is this unique chemistry between the guest and host that makes this interaction so fulfilling.  Curiosity, knowledge building, experience, kindness, intrigue, diversity and necessity all play a part.  To all guest past and future.... thank you.

Hosting and meeting people from all over the world is amazing- it makes me happy also; it is incredible what technology has allowed us to achieve in this way, here it is actually bringing people together.  Since I started hosting guests with Air' I have established some of the most spectacular friendships, exceeding my expectations.

In a nutshell: I'm a traveller, researcher, musician, fairly accomplished programmer, avid skier, and a general lover of life and everything to do with it.

In a slightly larger nutshell: I'm Petar. I was born in Cambridge, MA but moved back to Serbia a few months later. Lived there until 1999 when we moved back to the United States. I consider myself very lucky to be a child of two continents - this has allowed me to travel most of the world, and have fantastic times experiencing all of the different cultures, histories, and adventures that our little planet has to offer. I decided to join up on here as I wanted to expand my traveling network, and travel all over the world! For those who stay at my place - I know the Boston area in and out, and would be more than glad to show you what this fantastic city has to offer, and provide great accommodation. 

I'm a collector of memories, not things :)

Why I’m on AirBnB

The world is truly full of amazing people. When I'm not traveling, I'm happy to put up my place - I find it's a great way to travel, meet exceptional people and have fantastic experiences.

Interests

Many of my friends have described me as a renaissance man. If something interests me, I'll usually go out of my way to try it out. Currently, I've been on a bit of a language learning streak - I'm trying to get my German, French, and Italian to fairly passable levels. Thank God my Spanish is up to par!

Other than that, I've become quite interested in Art Deco architecture, and designs from that era. Can anyone say Bahaus?

Professionally, I'm a computer programmer, and a researcher in high performance computing. In this regard my interests, which probably bore pretty much everyone else have to do with efficient memory and cache, multithreaded program design, and all that other fun stuff.",N/A,N/A,N/A,f,Back Bay,1,1,"Boston, MA, United States",Back Bay,Back Bay,,Boston,MA,2116,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.3489,-71.08122,t,Apartment,Entire home/apt,3,1,1,2,Real Bed,$310.00,,,$500.00,$50.00,2,$30.00

I work from home, so I'm usually here to help my guests out in any way I can. My boyfriend, John, lives here, and if I'm not here to welcome you and give you tips on enjoying Boston, he'll do the honors!

I'm mad about organic gardening, used to keep bees but don't anymore, and my yard is a jungle full of birds and fruit that I wish the birds would let me eat.

I grow things. The garden is one of the best things about this house. It's gotten a little insane. Growth is a little rampant. It might eat you before you reach the front door. I apologize. Send up a flare!

Some of the most amazing times in my life have come about through traveling or hosting travelers to this beautiful city. I love meeting new people, hearing about their adventures, learning more about where they come from, and helping them have a wonderful time here in Boston. 

I've had Thai people help me count the steps out loud in Thai when visiting  a mountain temple in Chiang Mai. I've kayaked from Cambridge, down the Charles River, through the locks, out into Boston Harbor, and into a dock outside The Barking Crab restaurant for a lunch of fried clams—a local favorite! I've been to New Orleans to work with Habitat for Humanity in rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina. I've hiked the White Mountains. I've trekked France, I've studied Spanish in Madrid, I've tossed bread crumbs to fish in Greece. 

Come to Boston, and I'll do everything I can to make sure you make wonderful new travel memories here, dining under my grape arbor, visiting your children's college, walking the Freedom Trail or whatever else you wind up doing!

We are Romo and Nayeli - a young married couple living in Boston.

We are both originally from Texas, but met and got married in China. We both love to travel and are always planning new adventures.  Anywhere we go, we are always seeking for the latest culinary experience or that perfect balanced cocktail from a local bar tender.

Right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We truly believe that hospitality is the art of making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  It's the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always.  
 
Now, we have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand, spent time studying in Spain before moving to Beijing  in 2000 after graduating.  

Nayeli and I met in Shenzhen, China in 2010 and in 2015 we tied the knot in the great city of Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we decided to repatriate back to the US after 16 years of living and working abroad.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US, and even more so when we get the opportunity to call Boston home.

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Growing up in South Florida and having lived in Düsseldorf,Germany,Rabat,Morocco,Mystic Connecticut, Minneapolis,Minnesota,Portland,Oregon,Sacramento,California,New York, New York,Boston,Massachusetts among other places I have noticed a few things. Persuing a career in music brought me to the Northeast. I really enjoy the cultural offerings a place like Boston has to offer. The intellectual community surrounding the colleges. The artists, musicians,museums,concert halls,night clubs,etc have a way of making me want to stick around here. Not to mention the medical community ,hospitals ,researching (Website hidden by Airbnb) a beautiful place to live too. So close to the Ski areas. I love snowboarding myself. Business wise it's not lacking either.

I'm originally from Atlanta but have been living Boston in the famous the North End of Boston for the last 15 years.  Last summer I had the pleasure of AirBnB'ing in St. Petersburg Florida and I'm looking forward to continuing that here in Boston.  I owned and operated a hostel in downtown Boston for six years and I'm a big fan of hostels, so the spaces I rent are often shared.
.  
I love traveling, meeting travelers and helping them out with finding affordable accommodation where ever I am.  I'm opening another hostel soon and thought this would be a great way to continue what I like to do in the meantime.

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people. 

I love the freedom. I experience a great feeling of independence from traveling. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want. I can sleep in. I can stay out late.

We are Romo and Nayeli - a young married couple living in Boston.

We are both originally from Texas, but met and got married in China. We both love to travel and are always planning new adventures.  Anywhere we go, we are always seeking for the latest culinary experience or that perfect balanced cocktail from a local bar tender.

Right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We truly believe that hospitality is the art of making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  It's the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always.  
 
Now, we have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand, spent time studying in Spain before moving to Beijing  in 2000 after graduating.  

Nayeli and I met in Shenzhen, China in 2010 and in 2015 we tied the knot in the great city of Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we decided to repatriate back to the US after 16 years of living and working abroad.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US, and even more so when we get the opportunity to call Boston home.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

I'm originally from Atlanta but have been living Boston in the famous the North End of Boston for the last 15 years.  Last summer I had the pleasure of AirBnB'ing in St. Petersburg Florida and I'm looking forward to continuing that here in Boston.  I owned and operated a hostel in downtown Boston for six years and I'm a big fan of hostels, so the spaces I rent are often shared.
.  
I love traveling, meeting travelers and helping them out with finding affordable accommodation where ever I am.  I'm opening another hostel soon and thought this would be a great way to continue what I like to do in the meantime.

I have always appreciated a variety of experiences and I've done it all, from Hostel, to the Airbnb ""Live live like a local"", to the 5-Star Hotel experience.  They all have their benefits.

I'm recently retired, having spent 25 years in the financial services industry.  The last 10+ as a project manager.  

As part of my work responsibilities, I was regularly traveling to India.  I enjoyed the cultural exchange opportunity just as much as the project work and have been learning the Hindi language with a private tutor for the last few years.

Learning a new language later in life presents some additional and unique challenges.  My dirty little secret is that, as a native English speaker, at this point I think I know more Hindi grammar than English grammar :-)

I continue to look forward to seeing new places and meeting new people.

We are known for our distinctively furnished apartments in popular locations, and for our attentive service. You’ll find that our rates are quite reasonable. If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge.
